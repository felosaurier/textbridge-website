                        TextBridge began as a simple observation: communication barriers faced by deaf individuals and international travelers are significant yet often overlooked. In 2025, three students at HTL Ungargasse—Felix Horngacher, Oliver Kellner, and Raphael Klein—decided to tackle this challenge for their diploma project.
